Project Title: E-commerce Webshop - Investigating the Impact of Labels on User Decision-Making
This project involves the creation and analysis of an e-commerce webshop platform, specifically designed to examine whether the presence or absence of product labels affects customers' understanding of shampoos and subsequently, their purchasing behavior.

Project Overview
The website displays various shampoos that users can browse and add to their cart. Each product is presented with a card containing an image, its name, star ratings, and price. Some products feature labels such as 'Sustainable' or 'Gentle Soothing' to provide more information about the product attributes.

The primary focus of this project is to observe whether these labels influence the speed and efficiency of user decision-making, and whether they lead to an increase in the number of items added to the cart, under the assumption that users will have more confidence in their choices if they believe the shampoo will suit their hair needs.

Code Overview
The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap used for responsive design and UI components. JavaScript is also used to implement the 'Add to cart' functionality, which updates the cart number and displays a confirmation modal with product details.

Additionally, JavaScript interacts with the Google Optimize API for tracking the number of items added to the cart, an integral part of our research data collection.

Research Paper: "Cultural differences on attention and perceived usability: Investigating color combinations of animated graphics"
The associated research paper focuses on understanding the impact of product labels on customers' understanding and purchasing decisions of shampoos. We analyze whether these labels help users make faster decisions and increase their confidence in the suitability of their chosen products, leading to more items added to their cart.

The paper details our methodology, analysis, and conclusions based on the data collected from user interactions on the webshop platform. For more detailed information, please refer to the research paper included with this submission.
